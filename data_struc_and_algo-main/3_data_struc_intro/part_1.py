'''
 a data structure is a collection of values 
 algorithms the steps or processes put in place to manipulate the collection of values
'''

# a data sturcture is simply a file cabinet of different types e.g a backpack for school books
# drawers for your clothes fride for food etc
# we can put things in data structures and we can take things from data structures
# there are always trade offs every coding question has a trade off
# there are two parts to understanding data structure 1 how to build one with code 2 how to use one

'''
in order to understand the value of data structures we have to go deep down to see how a computer works
in order for a computer to run code it needs to keep track of things like variable and these are stored in the ram thats how programs run

on top of that we also have storage where we store things like our documents, video files music etc data on storage is persistent 
but in ram u lose the memory when it turns on  but the persistent storage is slow the cpu can access info in the ram alot faster


this ram is thought of as a big storage area containing numbered shelfs called adresses that allow us to run programs, each of these shelfs hold 8 bits each one of these numbers is a bit and a bit is a tiny electrical switch that can represent on or off 


and the cpu is connected to a memory controller which does the reading and writting of memory because of these connections from the memory controller we can access memory really fast for a computer to access 0 and 1 is faster than for a computer to access 0 and 1000 to optimize this a computer has a cpu cache that stores recent info

var a = 1
we represent integers in 32 bits  
each data type has a number of bits associated with it and has to get stored in the sys and the sys allocates that storage to it
'''

'''
each language has own datatype and datastructures 
e.g python 
list
object
dictionary
tuple

if your language does not have a data structure u can build one
'''

# operation of data sturctures
# insertion
# deletion
# traversal - access each data item once so it can be processed
# searching
# sorting
# access
